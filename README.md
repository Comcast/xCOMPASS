  <h1> xCOMPASS (COMcast Privacy ASSistant) </h1> 

xCOMPASS is a questionnaire developed from [Models of Applied Privacy (MAP) personas](https://github.com/Comcast/xCOMPASS/tree/main/personas) so that threat modelers can ask specific and targeted questions covering a range of privacy threats. Each question is linked to a persona. Before diving into privacy threats, the following scoping questions might be helpful during a threat modeling session. This is because the existence of personal information must be known, even if it is managed and is not an active threat. Team must ensure that these are properly handled when they exist, and reviews are done for special categories of such information.
